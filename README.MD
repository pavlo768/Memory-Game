Memory game

Hello everyone)
As part of my final project I made a game Memory Game, the logic of the game is simple to start the game you need to click on one of the levels of hard level is 80 seconds and Easy level is 60 seconds, you need to find two identical cards when two cards are found sound is played, there is also a sound when the card is not correct, there is also a sound when the card flip itself and there is a count of each flip, when all the cards are found, the audio sound of the win is played and the You Win window appears and after that the cards can be guessed without time just for yourself, also when the time runs out, a window about Time out and audio to it drops out, thank you all for your attention)
